## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

Can anyone fork this repo? - **YES, with conditions**.

I love to keep my site open source, but copying parts or entire code without giving original author any **credit** is not a good thing. I spent lot of nights and weekends in building and designing this website, and I'm happy that it came out as I expected and wanted! At the end do not claim this effort as your own.

Please also note that I'm not looking for any PR's to maintain and update this repo, I've created this site as a side kick project which evolved to be much more and I want to keep it that way.Feel free to fork and enhance the site with your own theming & functionalities.

### TL;DR

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please ensure to give me proper credit by linking back to [aateefuddin.netlify.app](https://aateefuddin.netlify.app). Cheers!

## Issues

Feel free to raise any bugs/issues you might find, will try to fix whenever I can.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use below flag for a production build.
`ng build mybrand --prod --aot --buildOptimizer --extractCss --no-namedChunks --ngswConfigPath=src/ngsw-config.json --optimization --outputHashing=all --serviceWorker --no-sourceMap --no-vendorChunk`

## Commit message semantics

We use [generate-changelog](https://github.com/lob/generate-changelog) for making CHANGELOG.md

`type(category): description [flags]`

Where type is one of the following:

  * `breaking`
